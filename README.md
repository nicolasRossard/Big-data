# BIG Data
This repository presents some exercices using Mapper and Reducer. For each part, there is a report in French which explains my work and my remarks.

To use correctly mapper and reducer you can use shell.sh


## TP1
Create Mapper, Reducer and put in Hadoop in JAVA and in Python

### Dataset (smalldata.txt):
[date] \t [time] \t [shop] \t [product] \t [cost] \t [paiment]

The script shell.sh is configured for cloudera quickstartVM with  Hadoop 2.6.0-cdh5.12.0.
Don't forget to modify this script if you want to use it in your machine. To execute all commands you have also to create a file in data/ named purchases.txt (like smalldata.txt but much bigger).
